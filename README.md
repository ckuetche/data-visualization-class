# data-visualization-class
This repository contains a script interpreting and visualizing DESeq2 Galaxy results in R. 
## Problem Overview
Data visualization is a key component of bioinformatics. It's important to be able to adequately process, interpret, and analyze/visualize results. For this script, I wanted to challenge myself to visualize and communicate the results I obtained after running the DESeq2 workflow in Galaxy. This script is important to me as it introduced R's capabilities in visualizing biologically significant results, such as upregulated and downregulated genes. Furthermore, effective data visualization in bioinformatics is not only about presenting data in a reliable, accurate way, but making sure your information/results obtained is accessible to techincal and nontechnical shareholders alike.
Through this process, I learned how to effectively use libraries such as dplyr and ggplot2 to customize graphs and organize my input results file. This taught me the importance of transforming statistical results into actionable results, and carefully evaluating the significance of upstream steps/actions to optimize the visualization process.
This script inspired me to write other plot generators, such as an MA plot generator in R, and later implement Galaxy's DESeq2 tool's plotting capabilities entirely in R. 
## Languages Used
All scripts are in R.
